            <h2>Reading</h2>
            Reading expands my horizons. It gives me something new and different to enjoy.
            And there are so many diverse subjects that i read about that i learn something every time that i read.
            <br>Over this habbit has given me immense confidence and a great vocabulary. I remember i was in 6th std when i started reading
            regularly.<br>I started small from the daily newspapers and gradually elevated my scope to various books and magzines.

            <h2>Yoga</h2>
            Yoga is one of my hobbie which keeps me sane. I sometimes do it in my bedroom, home, office, or the living room.
            It doesn't matter which place i am practicing,<br>it never fails to keep me energised and at peace.

            <h2>Cooking</h2>
            Cooking is what i am really fond of, it gives me immense pleasure and joy to put together myself in the kitchen.
            it's great if you have a partner in there with you, but even without them it's cool.
            <br>I create my own dishes and tweak all the known recipes and i must admit sometimes it comes out not so tasty,
            but most of the time the results are excellent.<br><br>
