'''
In a file called interpreter.py,
implement a program that prompts the user for an arithmetic expression
and then calculates and outputs the result as a floating-point value formatted to one decimal place.
Assume that the userâ€™s input will be formatted as x y z, with one space between x and y and one space between y and z,
wherein:
x is an integer
y is +, -, *, or /
z is an integer

# run kr re hain and test case bhi saare pass. but complexity ka kya ho?
