        <h2>Technology</h2>
        Since I was young, I have aspired to learn more about how technology works and the way we interact with it.
        My interest in science and technology began early in my life, when my family first got a Desktop PC.
        <br>I can clearly remember my fascination with its incredible capabilities, and this incredible piece of technology
        allowed for bonding opportunities in my family. For instance, my father would frequently teach me about all of the amazing things a
        PC is capable of doing, like calculating large numbers and accessing information from across the world at the click of a button.

        <h2>Programming</h2>
        When you spend a lot of your time solving problems, you end up getting pretty good at it!
        Coding is amazing because it can drastically improve your overall problem-solving skills.
        This in turn helps you to solve problems in other aspects of your life.
        Not only does learning how to code make you a better problem solver, but it also gives you more confidence in solving problems.
        Before I started coding, I was always very quick to give up on solving specific problems.
        Since I couldnâ€™t spin up a solution immediately, I also assumed there was no easy and elegant solution to the problem. My
        interest in coding also helps in my carrier aspirations.

        <h2>Politics</h2>
        Politics as a subject of interest has always fascinated me. I love to read about the past and present political systems,
        plotical thinkers, political decision making, theories and concepts of the same.
        If you are more interested in politics as a thought you can see my thoughts page <a href="thoughts.html"> here.</a>
